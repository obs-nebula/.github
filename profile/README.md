# hello

This GitHub organization works as follows:

* We have our central repository [Supernova](https://github.com/obs-nebula/supernova)
  * We create new things here first, and then if make sense to create a new repository we can close the issue and continue on the created repository.
* We have our project page here: https://github.com/orgs/obs-nebula/projects/1
  * But nobody is playing as project manager, this is just to have fun to dragging drop from `todo` to `in progress` and back and jump to `done`.
* We can change the direction anytime and just close the issue. :metal: :angel:
